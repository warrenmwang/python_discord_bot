# Discord Bot | Python 3
*last updated 05/27/2023*

## What does this do?
Interface for GPT-3.5-turbo / GPT-4 from OpenAI
Create your own random commands to improve your workflow if needed (I have some for prompt switching, saving threads, changing generation settings, etc.)
- for example, you could connect something like AutoGPT with this if you want

## Quick Setup (using pip/conda)
1. Prerequisites:
 - Discord Account
 - New Application for Discord Bot on Discord Developer Portal
 - Invited your new bot into your discord server
   - Any YouTube video can help you, I literally started with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoDLj0IzZMU) for this project
2. Clone/fork this repo
3. `cd` into the repo
4. `pip install -r requirements`
6. Create a `.env` file and put all your information in there
7. `python ./main.py`
8. Start talking!

## Notes
> Many past features that I thought would be fun to do, I found out I didn't use them, so I cut them off. (e.g. stablediffusion, gptrepl, random functions)
